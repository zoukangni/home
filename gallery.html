		<h2>&ldquo;Outsider Art&rdquo;</h2>
		<p>Outsider art is also known as &ldquo;Art Brut&rdquo;, a name that originated in France. This term is translated as raw, or rough art and was coined by the French artist Jean Dubuffet in 1947, when, in his manifesto, he stated, <i>&ldquo;We understand by this term works produced by persons unscathed by artistic culture, where mimicry plays little or no part (contrary to the activities of intellectuals). These artists derive everything...from their own depths, and not from the conventions of classical or fashionable art.&rdquo;</i> An &ldquo;outsider artist&rdquo; is defined as a self-taught, or untrained artist, which can often be seen in the appearance, layout, and content of their respective works. Uninfluenced by the constraints of the world of professional art, these artists are believed to create pieces solely for the purposes of expression, personal enjoyment, and creativity. Although the term Art Brut was previously thought to apply only to artists belonging to marginalized groups such as mediums, asylum inmates, and eccentrics, it is now used widely as a term to describe the artwork of untrained creators.</p>

		<!-- Intro Paragraph has specific style -->
		<p id="introp">&ldquo;Visual arts&rdquo; are defined as &ldquo;the arts created primarily for visual perception, as drawing, graphics,painting, sculpture, and the decorative arts.&rdquo; Artists can express themes, ideas, stories, emotions, and opinions through a variety of mediums from paint to film, creating works that have the ability to make lasting impacts  throughout history. These works, all tied together by the seven basic visual elements of  line, shape, tone, colour, pattern, texture, and form, are appreciated for their imaginative, aesthetic, or intellectual content.</p>

		<h2 class="homeh" id="homeh2">Art Mediums</h2> <!-- "homeh" class defines headings in home page, headings are indented -->
		<p class="homep">In terms of art, an art medium is the material used by an artist to create a piece of art. Artwork can be composed of multiple different media, which is referred to as multimedia art. Some common forms of art media are oil paint, canvas, graphite, ink, and clay. The art medium of any piece in a gallery or museum is often displayed along with its title and description, for example, &ldquo;Oil Paint on Canvas,&rdquo; which is could be used to describe the medium of  &ldquo;Starry Night&rdquo; by Vincent van Gogh.Many media can be divided into the two categories of student grade or artist grade, which affect the factors of both pricing and quality.</p>

		<h3 class="homeh">Paint</h3>
		<p class="homep">Paint is a general term used to describe a substance composed of solid pigment dissolved in a liquid medium. It can be applied to a multitude of different surfaces to create a work of art. This term encompasses materials such as watercolour, oil paint, acrylic paint, gouache, and tempera paint. They are usually either water based or oil based, but some types of paint may harbor characteristics of both. Different types of paints can vary in opacity, drying time, price, flexibility, and reflectiveness. </p>
		<h4 class="homeh">Pencil</h4>
		<p class="homep">The word &ldquo;pencil&rdquo;, according to the Visual Arts Cork Encyclopedia of Art, is derived from the Latin word, &ldquo;peniculus&rdquo;, which means &ldquo;brush&rdquo;. Traditional pencils consist of a graphite lead encased in a wooden shaft, although they are also available in the form of graphite sticks. Pencils are known as the most precise and convenient art medium due to their ability to produce thin lines from hard points, their small, lightweight form, and their nature of being a dry medium. The hardness of the graphite lead in the wooden shaft determines the appearance of the pencil marks it produces. Most pencils are graded along a spectrum from &lsquo;H&rsquo; &#40;hardness&#41; and &lsquo;B&rsquo; &#40;blackness&#41;, with the normal writing pencil being HB, the hardest being 9H and the softest being 9B.</p>
		<h5 class="homeh">Ink</h5>
		<p class="homep">Ink was developed in China in around the 7th or 8th century and was applied to scrolls of paper or sheets of silk. Due to its permanency, this medium was used to create handwritten manuscripts and religious and political documents. However, alongside its official and literary purposes, ink was also used to create detailed works of art depicting a variety of subjects, from history, to scenery, to daily life. It was developed into a medium used for detailed and precise work during the Renaissance through new tools such as wooden styluses and sharp metal shards that resemble the fountain pens used by calligraphy artists today. Besides calligraphy, ink is now also used with brushes, as before in China, in printmaking, and with other materials. There are pens that each produce different qualities of line such as thickness and fluidity. </p>
		<h6 class="homeh">Mixed Media</h6>
		<p class="homep">Also known as &ldquo;multimedia&rdquo;, mixed media art is artwork that can combine any number of materials. Artists can create a collage from a multitude of media such as magazines, newspapers, paint, and fabric, or create something simple with no more than two mediums, such as watercolour with pen. Many Indigenous artists use this method of multimedia artwork to assemble multiple ideas into one piece, or concept, an example being the artwork of Canadian artist, Carl Beam.</p>

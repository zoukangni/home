		<p class="firstp">The history of art dates back even further than written history, all the way to the earliest cave paintings of the Stone Age &#40;30,000 B.C.-2500 B.C.&#41;. Due to its sheer extensiveness and complexity, this history is categorized into &lsquo;art periods&rsquo; or &lsquo;art movements&rsquo;. They are a way to describe a style of art spanning over a period of time that is different from a style of art spanning over another period of time. One style changes, or &ldquo;moves&rdquo; into the next, defined by a group of famous artists within the same time period and&frasl;or region. Art periods are art movements listed in chronological order from the Stone Age to Postmodernism. There are a multitude of art periods and subcategories of art periods, but a few that have made the largest impact on art history are the Renaissance, Baroque, Romanticism, Impressionism, and Abstract Expressionism. These movements are inherently connected to the historical events that took place during their respective time periods, reflecting on the daily lives and periodic culture of the artists as well as the people they are surrounded by.</p>
		<h2>Renaissance &#40;1400-1550&#41;</h2>
		<p>The Renaissance art movement took place after the Middle Ages, or the Dark Ages. This term that literally translates into &lsquo;rebirth&rsquo; reflects on a transition into political stability, scientific advancement, economic growth, and an increasingly sophisticated society. This movement was strongly founded upon a desire to move away from the heavily religious themes of the Middle Ages, while numerous artists and writers sought to revive the culture, languages and ideals of Greece and Rome.Their efforts resulted in a movement heavily based on classical Greek art, with a centered focus on the realistic representation of the human form and expression. The most famous example of Renaissance art would be the Mona Lisa, painted by Leonardo Da Vinci, but there is also the incredibly influential work of Michelangelo, a representative artist of the Renaissance.</p>

		<h3>Baroque &#40;1600-1750&#41;</h3>
		<p>Baroque art strongly reflected the religious conflicts between the Catholic and Protestant churches following the Protestant Reformation, resulting in prominent religious themes. In these conflicts, art was used as a type of weapon that would promote political agendas through large-scale works of public art made to grab attention and impress. Artists would often use large swirls, upward diagonals, and rich, bright colour schemes to grab the attention of passersby. The content of these paintings usually portrayed overtly biblical, mythological, or allegorical elements that were made to appear larger than life.</p>

		<h4>Romanticism &#40;1780-1850&#41;</h4>
		<p>The development of Romanticism took off soon after the end of the French Revolution that took place in 1789. At this time, Europe had experienced significant changes in society throughout a continuous struggle for the people&rsquo;s ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity. Although it was similar to its preceding Neoclassicism in that it had a focus on the individual being, it introduced the new element of emotion. Unlike its more restrained, impersonal Neoclassicism counterpart, Romanticism celebrated a return to nature through the promotion of justice for all, valuing senses and emotions over reason and intellect, and personal emotional responses to life.</p>

		<h5>Impressionism &#40;1865-1885&#41;</h5>
		<p>Impressionism, originating from Paris in 1860 and spreading throughout Europe, is considered to be the first distinctly modern art movement. The defining characteristic of Impressionist art is that, in place of detail, artists captured the momentary <em>impression</em> of a scene. Instead of a definite shape, an Impressionist would capture the sensory effect of an object that can be caught at a glimpse. To create this effect, many artists relocated from the city to the countryside to paint <i>en plein air</i>, in open air. Due to the loose brushwork and deliberately abandoned clarity of this style, it was often criticized and said to have an unfinished, amateur-like quality. A few famous Impressionists are also some of the most influential artists of all time, such as Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Paul C&eacute;anne.</p>

		<h6>Abstract Expressionism &#40;1940-1960&#41;</h6>
		<p>Abstract Expressionism was born in New York in the 1940s and it was what pushed that city ahead of Paris as the leader of modern art. Abstract Expressionists were defined by a term encompassing a variety of art styles, but what they all had in common were the expression of emotion and universal themes, often in a surreal or formless manner, hence the term &lsquo;abstract&rsquo;. This art was embraced by the public and woven into consumerism for being authentically &lsquo;American&rsquo;, with its large-scale pieces, romantic mood, and chaotic, individual freedom. The most well-known names in Abstract Expressionism include Jackson Pollock, Andy Warhol, and Mark Rothko.</p>
